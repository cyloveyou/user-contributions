last update June 2020

todo:
---
create get_dem.csh
update creation of intf.in file 
create merge_tops step in gmtsar_app
map workflow and simplify gmtsar_app 
(fix in GMTSAR): preproc_batch_tops_esd.csh deletes the baseline_table.dat file
landmask_manual.csh uses hard-coded -I value - may be wrong for ALOS2

check still working:
---
use of SAT_baseline vs ALOS_baseline in align.csh
use of original baseline_table.csh in non-S1 pre_proc_batch.csh

files notes:
---
align_batch.csh        : modified to enable ALOS2 batch alignment and parallel alignment. Should merge into GMTSAR master
align.csh              : modified to enable ALOS2 batch alignment and parallel alignment. Should merge into GMTSAR master
filter.csh             : modified to allow changing psize value. Should merge into GMTSAR master
focus_master.csh       : very short, special command to enable parallel alignment. Should merge into GMTSAR master
goldstein_filter.csh   : special command to run goldstein filter by itself. Should merge into GMTSAR master
grd_io.py              : used to read GMT GRD files into python - for nneigh_interp 
intf_batch.csh         : modified to enable ALOS2 batch processing. Should merge into GMTSAR master
intf_tops.csh          : lots of modifications, to enable 3-stage processing, psize, and custom snaphu_interp. Needs testing
landmask_manual.csh    : special command to make landmask easier to use. Merge back / delete?
make_los_products.csh  : make ascii files. Seems more complete than make_los_ascii.csh in GMTSAR?
nneigh_interp.py       : use python to interpolate masked phase for snaphu_interp. Should test against the GMT method
pre_proc_batch.csh     : modified to enable ALOS2 and TSX batch processing. Should eventually merge into GMTSAR master, lots of testing needed.
proj_ra2ll_hi.csh      : small modification to hard-code high-resolution geocoding. Convenience script 
snaphu_interp.csh      : uses python interpolation to greatly speed up unwrapping. Should test against the GMT method 
topo_ra.csh            : split off from intf_batch and intf_tops to better enable parallel processing. Should merge into GMTSAR master
