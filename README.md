# user-contributions
For advanced users to maintain and share their codes to the InSAR community.

## Creating your package
Make a pull request and create a folder with your package name. Add your codes/scripts to the package and write a README.md file to describe
1) Description of the package
2) Dependicies
3) How to install
4) Examples on how to use your package

We will approve your pull request only checking whether you modified other contributors packages. No actual examination on the codes/scripts will be done. All contributors are responsible for their own packages.

## Become a routine contributor 
If you need to constantly modify or update your package, contact @Xiaohua-Eric-Xu to gain access to the repository.
