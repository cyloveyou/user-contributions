Sentinel-1 query and download script

This repository contains a simple script that enables easy search and download of Sentinel-1 (or other SAR) data hosted at the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) using the ASF API. For help on this API, visit https://asf.alaska.edu/api/.

The basic use of the script is as follows: enter API keywords and values in a config file (example included), then pass this file as a single argument on the command line. The script will generate an API query, and download the resulting .csv file of results.

The default is to return a search query (csv file) but not download the data. To download the granules after searching, add the command-line option --download. To print out a human-readable table of the results to the screen, use --verbose.

Here is a simple config file example, which returns IW scenes collected during part of April and May 2019 from Path 56 over Albuquerque, NM:

    [api_search]
    output = csv
    platform = Sentinel-1A,Sentinel-1B
    processingLevel = SLC
    beamMode = IW
    intersectsWith = POLYGON((-106.7975 34.9141,-106.3267 34.9141,-106.3267 35.3502,-106.7975 35.3502,-106.7975 34.9141))
    start=2019-04-05T00:00:00UTC
    end=2019-05-05T00:00:00UTC
    relativeOrbit=56

    [download]
    download_site = both
    nproc = 2

    [asf_download]
    http-user = <username>
    http-password = <password>

To run the code with the above config file:

    python sentinel_query_download.py sentinel_query.config --verbose

This should result in the following output:

    Sentinel query complete.

If you are satisfied with the scenes found, then run the code again with the --download option:

    python sentinel_query_download.py sentinel_query.config --verbose --download

If you set download_site = both, the script is set up to prefer downloading from the AWS Sentinel-1 Public Dataset for Southeast Asia; if no file is found there we fall back to downloading from ASF directly (this requires an ASF account). To force ASF-only downloading, set download_site = ASF. For more information on the AWS dataset, see https://registry.opendata.aws/sentinel1-slc-seasia-pds/ - this includes all SLC data acquired over Southeast Asia and parts of East Asia by Sentinel-1, and is hosted in the Singapore AWS region. Depending on your location, this may be much faster (or slower) than downloading from ASF directly.

Running multiple downloads in parallel is possible through the python multiprocessing toolbox, via the config file option 'nproc'. The true effective speedup from running many downloads at the same time has not been tested; this may depend on your own storage and bandwidth situation.
